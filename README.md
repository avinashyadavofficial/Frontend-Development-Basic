- Utility Methods: `$.grep()`, `$.map()`, `filter()`, `sort()`
- Event Handling
- Data Binding and DOM Updates
- Form Validations 
- Response Management and Status Handling
- Local Storage API for Persistent Data

###  HTML5 & CSS3
- Semantics and Structure with HTML5
- Styling with CSS3
- Responsive Design with Media Queries
- CSS Layout Techniques: Flexbox, Float
- SASS Preprocessor: Nesting, Variables, and Mixins
- Project Structure Best Practices

## Final Sprint Project

To implement all the learned concepts practically, we developed a full-featured **Employee Payroll Application**.

### Employee Payroll App Highlights:
- Add, edit, delete employee records
- Real-time search, filter, and sort features
- jQuery-based dynamic table rendering
- Dashboard with salary insights
- Form validations and localStorage support
- Backend simulation with JSON Server

> This project consolidated all our sprint learnings into a complete web application.
